                    In my life, I’ve come to believe that the spiritual world is just as real as the physical, 
                    and very likely even more complex and vast. It is my intention to create artwork that challenges materialist 
                    paradigms and sparks conversations about the spiritual through the presentation of questions: What is the nature 
                    and structure of the spiritual world? How do we interact with it? What benevolence or malevolence might it hold? 
                    What is the nature of the relationship between the material and non-material?
                </p>

                    Conceptually, my work has been inspired by creation myths and cosmological maps of many different ancient cultures 
                    (such as the ancient Maya, Norse, Israelites, Chinese, and Egyptians) which try to make sense of reality and where we 
                    belong in it. However, my work is open to interpretation, which reflects the inherent mystery of the subject. 
                    Worldbuilding has also been a prominent theme in my practice as I’ve found creating my own world to be useful in 
                    better understanding this one. For this reason, The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis has also played an influential 
                    role in my art.

                    The fantastical nature of many of my illustrations conveys a sense of deep longing for all the good and beautiful things 
                    these realms hold, while the unsettling, sometimes sinister subject matter stems from an underlying sense of the evil also 
                    present within both the physical and spiritual worlds. I’m drawn to the most basic elements of nature as the subject matter 
                    for my work (e.g., sun, moon, stars, flora, fauna, the human form, etc.) as these forms tend to be most free of distracting 
                    connotations or associations and instead draw the viewer's attention to the earth and physicality itself. The compositions are 
                    collage-like and symmetrical, often with many niches, referencing religious iconography.

                    My work is multidisciplinary, including acrylic, oil, watercolor, marker/pen, ceramic, linocut, and mixed media. I’m enamored 
                    by materials that are highly sensual or tactile, and my work is often stylistically graphic with clear and distinct elements. 
                    Though my compositions could be described as diagrammatic, they tend to be less literal than a true cosmological map and more 
                    emotional and intuitive. I usually start with a very basic central idea and compositional structure then instinctually integrate 
                    or subtract elements as they contribute to or detract from the strength of the piece. The flatness of my work lends itself to be 
                    better understood as an illustration full of symbolic meaning rather than a scene to be taken literally.
                </p>

                    I’ve often found it difficult to orient myself metaphysically within this intersection of the spiritual and physical we find 
                    ourselves in. It is my hope that the work I produce would serve as an atlas of sorts or that it would prompt viewers to ponder 
                    their own potential interactions with the spiritual.
